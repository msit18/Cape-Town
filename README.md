# Cape-Town

MIT Senseable City Lab collaboration with the City of Cape Townâ€™s Transport and Urban Development Authority (TDA). These are misc files related to the project.

The code hosted on the Heroku server can be found at: https://github.com/msit18/CitiVan

This folder contains:
- Code used to analyze the minibus taxi license plates, plate numbers, and preliminary report sent to TDA. An updated version of the report can be found in the Progress Report.
- Old Citivan App folder:
    - This folder contains the original work created by Wajeeha Ahmad and Tawanda Zimuto.
    - Nahom Marie and I were unable to open the zip folder or figure out how to operate it. We were able to run and test the ruby file included in the folder. Our findings can be found in the report included.
